Create a base class called Father and derived class called Son which extends  the base class. In Father class, implement a constructor which takes the age and throws the user defined exception WrongAge( ) when the input age<0. In Son class, implement a constructor that checks both father and son’s age and throws an using defined exception AgeInvalid( ) if son’s age is >=father’s age.

class Father:
    def __init__(self, age):
        if age < 0:
            raise WrongAge("Age cannot be negative")
        self.age = age

class Son(Father):
    def __init__(self, father_age, son_age):
        super().__init__(father_age)
        if son_age >= father_age:
            raise AgeInvalid("Son's age cannot be greater than or equal to father's age")
        self.age = son_age

class WrongAge(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

try:
    father = Father(-10)
except WrongAge as e:
    print(e)

try:
    son = Son(30, 25)
except AgeInvalid as e:
    print(e)
